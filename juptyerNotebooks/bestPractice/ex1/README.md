# About

I use Jupyter notebooks to process datasets. As such I am connecting the notebook to databases, external APIs, and other resources requiring connections I want to remain private and not be included in the notebook. 
In this example I will outline how I segment and separate the elements of the notebook so not everything is added directly to the notebook file.
